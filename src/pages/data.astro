    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>
      The calculator relies on data collected by the Maryland Department of
      Transportation (MDOT) and publicly available at:
      <a
        target="_blank"
        href="https://roads.maryland.gov/mdotsha/Pages/index.aspx?PageId=302"
        >https://roads.maryland.gov/mdotsha/Pages/index.aspx?PageId=302
        </a
      >. Data is available in either Excel or pdf format.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data provide estimates of road mileage and annual VMT by county for seven
      functional classifications of roads in urban areas and an additional
      seven for rural areas. Functional classifications define the type of
      service provided by a road, for example a freeway, turnpike, or
      expressway allows for higher speeds and will accommodate more vehicles
      per hour compared to an arterial road, which will have traffic signals
      and lower speeds. At the far extreme are local roads with low speed
      limits that serve final destinations, such as residential and local
      commercial areas.
    </p>
    <p>
      We combined some of the road classifications to minimize those
      instances in which there were zero road miles (for example, many of
      the more urbanized counties had no roads classified as rural or had
      minimal miles of roads under that category). We combined
      interstates with principal arterials/freeways/expressways as these both largely have
      identical road designs, including being largely controlled access
      highways. We also combined major and minor collector roads into one category. In total we have 
      five road categories for both urban and rural roads in the calculator. The data includes both annual 
      vehicle miles of travel and lane miles for each road type for all 23 counties 
      plus Baltimore City (which is equivalent to a county jurisdiction).
        </p>
       <p>
      Our first year of data is 2017 and we will update to the latest year
      available. Caution should be used when analyzing data and interpreting
      results for 2020 and 2021 due to changes in travel patterns due to the
      COVID pandemic.
    </p>
    <p>We also include an estimate of CO2 equivalent emissions. This is estimated based on the average on-road 
      transportation CO2 equivalent emissions per mile for the entire state which is 361.5 grams/mile. Data on 
      total state on-road transportation emissions was taken from the <a target="_blank" href="https://mde.maryland.gov/programs/Air/ClimateChange/Pages/GreenhouseGasInventory.aspx"
        >Maryland Greenhouse Gas Inventory</a> using 2020 data.</p>
    <p>
      Elasticity assumptions in the calculator are shown in the table for
      each road classification. In general, the empirical evidence suggests
      that larger higher speed roads have a larger elasticity. We have
      included a range and the calculator output provides a range of
      estimates for induced VMT. Given the potential range of estimates and
      variation in how VMT may be affected, we have included a
      “back-calculator” which allows the estimation of an “implied
      elasticity” based on forecast growth in VMT associated with a capacity
      expansion. This can be thought of as the elasticity implied by any
      forecasts of travel done by a state DOT or a local agency promoting the
      capacity expansion. The assumption often made, is that there is no
      change in VMT attributable to the expansion, despite the evidence for
      induced travel. The user of the calculator is thus able to assess
      whether estimates made in forecasts are reasonable.

    <h2>Calculations</h2>
    <p>
      The elasticities shown above are used to determine how a change in
      lane miles will lead to a change in annual VMT. The formula for estimating
      the induced VMT is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <math display="block">
        <semantics>
          <mrow>
            <mrow>

              <mo stretchy="false">=</mo>
              <mi>ε</mi>
            </mrow>
            <mi>∙</mi>
            <mfrac>
              <mi mathvariant="italic">NewLM</mi>
              <mi mathvariant="italic">LM</mi>
            </mfrac>
            <mi>∙</mi>
            <mi mathvariant="italic">VMT</mi>
          </mrow>
        </semantics>
      </math>
    </p>
    <p>
      Where:
      <ul>
        <li>ε = elasticity</li>
        <li>NewLM = the newly added lane mileage for the county</li>
        <li>LM = the current lane mileage in the county</li>
        <li>VMT = the current vehicle-miles of travel in the county</li>
        <li>
          Induced<sub>VMT</sub> = the vehicle miles of travel induced by the
          increase in lane miles
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The back-calculation simply reverses this equation but requires the
      user to input both “new lane miles” and the “forecasted annual increase in
      VMT”. The output is an implicit elasticity, that is, the elasticity
      that is implied by the forecast increase in VMT.
